This is a small and silly project to see how a bunch of Japanese kanji (Chinese characters) look when composited on top of each other. For no other reason than curiosity.

This uses JSTalk to script the excellent mac image editor Acorn. http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/

The action happens in the Composited kanji layers.jstalk file.

jlpt_kanji_1-2230_1kx1k_darken.png is an example of all the JLPT kanji composited on top of each other using the darken layer blending on a 1000x1000 canvas.
